In the second model, it would be interesting to vary the depletion rate $s_E$. Interestingly, as $s_E$ increases, the steady value of $z_t$ increases, but the steady state growth rate in output per worker **decreases**! This is so, because in the short-run, a higher $s_E$ increases productivity, but in the long run, it falls!\n",

Other ideas could be to make explicit microfoundations for the households' choices, include human capital, use a CES production function instead of a Cobb-Douglas or perhaps look at an endogenous growth model. Using a CES production function would have implications on the elasticity of substitution between production factors."

In this specification, the model is solved using the capital-output ratio, which converges to a steady state level. Including a scarce, depletable natural resource such as oil puts even more drag on growth. However, in both cases, the Cobb-Douglas production function and technological growth allows for long-run growth."
