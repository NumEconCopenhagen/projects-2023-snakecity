# Data analysis project

My project is titled **Data project: The fishing industry in Denmark ** and is about select data on the Danish fishing industry.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**, all from Statistics Denmark:

1. **FISK1**: Danish vessels by region, unit, type of vessels, length and tonnage
1. **FISK2**: Landings by Danish vessels by region, harbour, unit and type of fish
1. **SKIB95**: Accidents at sea involving danish vessels by type of accident, type of vessel and scope
1. **MRU1**: Air Emission Accounts by industry and type of emission (*source*) 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project may require installation of some of the packages seen in the import section of the notebook.
