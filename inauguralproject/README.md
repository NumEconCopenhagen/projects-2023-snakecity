# Inaugural project
This project is the first project of the course **Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis** at Copenhagen University.
The aim of the project is to learn how to solve a simple economic model and present the results.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
